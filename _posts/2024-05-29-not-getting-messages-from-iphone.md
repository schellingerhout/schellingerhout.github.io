Who is to blame for when a Samsung user with a new phone number can't get text messages from iPhones. 

<!--more-->
Spoiler: It may be Apple's fault, you can fix it very easily.

## You've tried it all
* Rebooted your phone, 
* Checked your APNs,
* Even called your cell provider's support (where all three people you talk to are called "John"),
* Sent SMS and MMS messages to friends that receive them fine
* Received text messages from other Android phones,
but you just don't receive any text messages from iPhones. ðŸ˜¡

## iMessage 

iMessage is a secure message protocol and app for sending messages over the Internet. So what does iMessage have to do with your problem? Well if you got a new phone or a new phone number your old number may have been recycled. If your old number is still associated with iMessage then it seems that Apple will send it via iMessage instead of via SMS, meaning you will never receive it.

## So how do you fix this?

So how do I remove my phone number from iMessage if I've never even used iMessage or owned an iPhone. 

The solution is very easy: 
1. go to [Apple's page dedicated to deregistering from iMessage](https://selfsolve.apple.com/deregister-imessage)
2. Enter your phone number and it will send you a code to de-register, 
3. then text a friend with an iPhone to send you a test text message

## Conclusion
I hope that you found this useful or at least interesting.
